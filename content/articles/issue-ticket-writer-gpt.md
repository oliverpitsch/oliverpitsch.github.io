Title: The GPT That Turns Feature Ideas into Ready-to-Ship GitHub Issues
author: Oliver Pitsch
description: I built a GPT that instantly transforms loose feature ideas into clean, GitHub-ready issue markdown ready for Copilot to pick up and build.

A few days ago I [shared how GitHub Copilot shipped a complete feature while I was shopping groceries](/articles/copilot-built-feature-while-shopping).
That story got a lot of attention and one question kept coming up:

**‚ÄúHow exactly did Copilot know what to build?‚Äù**

The truth is, it all starts with how you _write your tickets._

### From vague ideas to precise prompts

I‚Äôve been experimenting with a small GPT that acts as a _Product Issue Documentation Assistant_.
You give it a rough feature idea, a bug report, or a product improvement.
In return, it gives you a **perfectly formatted GitHub issue**, ready for Copilot _or any engineer_ to pick up.

Each ticket includes:

- **A clear summary**, problem, goal, and acceptance criteria
- **Consistent markdown** structure (no fluff)
- **Optional UX copy blocks** in both English and German
- **Enough context** for Copilot to start coding instantly

Think of it as a bridge between _product thinking_ and _AI-assisted development._

---

### Why it matters

Writing a great ticket is half the work of building a great feature.
And when AI tools like Copilot can now interpret those tickets directly,
**the quality of your documentation becomes the new developer interface**.

This GPT helps standardize that step, so your team (or just you) can move faster, with more clarity and fewer handoffs.

If Copilot can code while you‚Äôre shopping,
this GPT makes sure it knows _exactly what to build._
